                     My name is Stacy Sambu Chepsergon. I am 20 years old, turning 21 on 31st March, 2022(Sometimes, I wonder how I reached here. It was literally yesterday I was joining highschool).
                     I'm currently in 3rd year pursuing Bachelor of Commerce at The University of Nairobi. It's going on quite well, can't complain.
                     <p>
                     I have a passionate relationship with food. I love cooking and absolutely enjoy baking. My first baking experience taught me that baking is a hands-on art that you perfect overtime. It was during a homescience lesson and I was paired up with three other guys. Our instructor measured out all the ingredients for us and all we had to do was mix them and throw it in the oven. Well, it turned out okay for the first trial. Shock on me when I tried to recreate the same at home. It was a disaster. I think I created a poison that is yet to be discovered. I'm not even kidding. However, for my love of cake, I didn't lose hope. I wanted to bake to Java's standards. I went back to the drawing board and learnt where I went wrong, which were the proportions of the ingredients. I bet you thought this would be a happily ever story, it wasn't. This time I baked something edible but it still wasn't Java. It took me over 100 trials, literally, and I can now confidently say you can't differentiate my chocolate fudge cake from Java's. All it takes is passion, determination and of course, accurate measurements.</p>
                    <P> I am such a social butterfly. Hanging out with my friends is so refreshing, especially if we enjoy the same leisure activities like discovering new restaurants and trying other culture's food, going on multiple girl dates to catch up and treat ourselves and even creating a bookclub to make reading fun and get an excuse to see each other during the book review. It's quite clear that quality time is my love language.</P>
                     
                     <P>If I were to choose between a world without colour and a world without music, definitely I would choose  a world without colour. I love music. Music keeps me going. It kick-starts my day, brightens up Mondays, reminds me of special people and moments, it is a vibe going into the weekend and humbles you back to the creator on Sundays. The genre that interests me currently is old-school Kenyan music as it reminds me of my childhood when my only worries were eating, sleeping, watching cartoons and doing homework. <STRONG>Adulting is a scam.</STRONG></P>
                 <P> <strong>Welcome</strong> to my website as I fill you in with things to do with baking, lifestyle and creating memories.</P>
